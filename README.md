***This is a simple brick breaker game for learning GitHub collaboration and version control***

*The code is a basic Java Swing application for a brick breaker game. It doesn't rely on any external modules or dependencies. It uses standard Java libraries and the Swing framework for creating the graphical user interface.*

1. Java Standard Library: The code primarily uses classes and libraries provided by the Java Standard Library. This includes javax.swing, java.awt, java.awt.event, and other standard Java packages.

2. Swing Framework: Swing is a part of the Java Standard Library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides classes like JFrame, JPanel, and Timer for building GUI-based applications.

3. No External Dependencies: There are no external dependencies or additional libraries being used. Everything is built using core Java and Swing.

To run this code, you'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can compile and run the code using standard Java development tools such as *javac* and *java*
